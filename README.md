# Awesome Canvas

Awesome is awesome, but it's initial config file, because of all it's comments and explaining, is very informative but awful. For me, it is hard to follow and tricky to change. It makes me feel discouraged to invent, I'm never sure of what I want to keep and what I want to remove. It's easy to end up with a half-baked, "never wanna see it again" file. So, being the "hands-on" and a "from-scratch" type of person (I use ~~Arch~~ Gentoo btw), I created this minimal, blank-slate `rc.lua` config.

It's free of:
  - Colors and themes _that overwhelm_
  - Background images _that drains your creative self_
  - Decorated clients _that someone else decorated_
  - Root menus _without any good option_
  - Top/bottom bars _that bar you from beeing yourself_
  - Help popups _that only help themselves_
  - App Launchers _that you never launch_
  - Keys and buttons _that are best left unpressed_
  - autorun.sh _to where?_

It has:
  - A single tag for each screen
  - Client placement on foscused screen
  - Keys
    - Mod+Control to restart aweome
    - Mod+Enter to launch a terminal
    - Mod+q to kill focused client
  - Client focus when clicked
  - Error notifications
  - Enough room for you to be the innovative, creative sunflower that you already are

All of these are in neat functions that are easy to understand, change and get rid of once you create your ~~own stuff~~ linux art.
